## Preset Templates

Squonker ships with these default preset templates that you can select and use for your instruments. 

### Drum Templates

* `Highpass`: does what it says on the tin
* `Lowpass`: also does what it says on the tin
* `Boing`: introduces some interesting envelopes for bendy and swooshy effects

### Notes templates

* `Basic`: Adjustable attack and decay envelopes + bounce
* `Bass2`: bass template with an emphasis on filters and resonance
* `BassBasic`: bass template with slightly gentler filter envelopes for cowards
* `Envelope1`: notes template with adjustable attack and some filter options. A compromise.
* `Envelope2`: notes template which defaults to a long attack for pad-style instruments
* `Lowpass`: Another bass template with an emphasis on filters and resonance, but somehow slightly different from the other one in ways I can't remember
* `Notes2`: basically the same as Bass2 but it's Notes instead
